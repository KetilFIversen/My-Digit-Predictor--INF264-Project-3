To run the Jupyter notebook, make sure the data files 'handwritten_digits_images.csv' and 'handwritten_digits_labels.csv' are in the same folder as
the Jupyter notebook file.
Run each cell in the correct sequence from top to bottom. IMPORTANT! This code will take about 4 hours to run. Luckily all of my output is 
already there to look at without having to run it from scratch.
